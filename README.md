## CSS

### Properties

- **_box-sizing_**:The `box-sizing` property in CSS determines how the total width and height of an element is calculated. By default, the width and height of an element is calculated based on the content, padding, and border. With `box-sizing: border-box`, the width and height of an element is calculated based on the content, padding, and border, with the padding and border included in the total width and height. This property is useful for creating layouts with precise dimensions and spacing, without having to account for the additional width and height created by padding and border.

> **_What is the difference between a class and an id in html?_**

- In HTML, a class is a way to group HTML elements with similar styles or functions, while an ID is a unique identifier for a specific HTML element.

  - Classes can be used for multiple elements, and one element can have multiple classes. This allows you to apply the same styling or functionality to multiple elements without having to repeat the code.

  - IDs, on the other hand, can only be used once per page and are used to uniquely identify a specific element. They are often used for JavaScript and CSS to target specific elements for styling or functionality.

  ```html
  <section class="parallax">
    <h2 id="text">Parallax Website</h2>
  </section>
